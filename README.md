# Melanoma-Daignosis
 
Melanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer, and its early detection is critical to improving patient survival rates. In this research, we present a precision diagnostic system leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze DICOM dermoscopic images. We trained two convolutional neural networks, ResNet and EfficientNet, on a large dataset of dermoscopic images, with EfficientNet demonstrating superior performance in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. For cases classified as benign, a secondary classifier was employed to further categorize the lesions as either nevus or unknown, providing deeper diagnostic insight. Our system includes effective preprocessing techniques, enhancing image quality and feature extraction, which is visually represented in the final interface. To improve usability, we developed an interactive interface using Streamlit, enabling clinicians to visualize real-time diagnosis results and access additional information extracted from the DICOM metadata, including patient demographics and image acquisition details. This combination of advanced image analysis, metadata integration, and preprocessing offers a comprehensive tool to assist clinicians in making more informed and accurate melanoma diagnoses. The proposed system is designed to improve diagnostic precision, reduce human error, and facilitate early detection, ultimately contributing to more effective melanoma treatment strategies.
